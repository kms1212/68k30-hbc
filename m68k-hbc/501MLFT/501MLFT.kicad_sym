The name LOCO stands for Low Cost Oscillator, as it is designed to replace crystal oscillators in most electronic systems. Using Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) techniques, the device uses a standard fundamental mode, inexpensive crystal to produce output clocks up to 160 MHz. Stored in the chip\'s ROM is the ability to generate nine different multiplication factors, all" (at 26.67 -294.92 0)
